## INTRODUCTION

Use `Tamper Monkey` & login to Bilibili for the best video quality
=> Enable `Check Update` for Tamper Monkey, I regularly fix any bug that happen.

Not the best script, but usable. There are many "flavor" of biliint site, if they use the same api, this script will problably work. If there any problem, open an issue.
